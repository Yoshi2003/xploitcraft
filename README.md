```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

### Step 7: Install Docker

#### Install Docker:

```bash
sudo apt install -y docker.io
```

#### Start and Enable Docker Service:

```bash
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
```

#### Verify Docker Installation:

```bash
docker --version
```

Expected Output:
```plaintext
Docker version 23.xx.x, build xxxxxxx
```

### Step 8: Install Docker Compose

```bash
sudo apt install -y docker-compose
```

#### Verify Installation:

```bash
docker-compose --version
```

Expected Output:
```plaintext
docker-compose version 1.29.2, build 5becea4c
```

### Step 9: Add Your User to the Docker Group
To run Docker commands without `sudo`:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

**Important:** Log out and log back in or run:

```bash
newgrp docker
```

### Step 10: Build and Run the Application with Docker Compose

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

#### Explanation:
- `docker-compose up`: Starts the containers.
- `--build`: Rebuilds Docker images to incorporate the latest changes.

#### Accessing the Application:

Open your web browser and navigate to:

```plaintext
http://localhost
```

You should see the ProxyAuthRequired.com application running.

## Development and Editing Instructions

### Step 1: Modify `docker-compose.yml` for Development

```bash
nano docker-compose.yml
```

#### Add `node_modules` Volume:

```yaml
frontend:
  container_name: frontend_service
  build:
    context: ./frontend/my-react-app
    dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev
  ports:
    - "3000:3000"
  volumes:
    - ./frontend/my-react-app:/app
    - /app/node_modules
  networks:
    - xploitcraft_network
  restart: always
```

#### Update Build Context and Dockerfile:

```yaml
frontend:
  build:
    context: ./frontend/my-react-app
    dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev
```

#### Save and Exit:
- In `nano`, press `CTRL + O`, then `CTRL + X`.
- In `vim`, press `ESC`, type `:wq`, and press `ENTER`.
- In `gedit`, save and close the file.

### Step 2: Rebuild and Restart the Containers

```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose up --build
```

### Step 3: Edit Docker Compose Configuration (Optional)

```bash
nano docker-compose.yml
```

### Step 4: Accessing the Development Environment

- **Frontend:** Located in `./frontend/my-react-app`
- **Backend:** Located in `./backend`

## Additional Configuration Tips

### Environment Variables
Ensure all necessary environment variables are correctly set in the `.env` file. Refer to `ENV_example` for guidance.

### Managing Docker Permissions

```bash
groups $USER
```

If `docker` is not listed, re-add your user:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker
```

### Stopping the Application

```bash
docker-compose down
```

### Viewing Logs

```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Docker Daemon Not Running

```bash
sudo systemctl status docker
```

If it’s not running:

```bash
sudo systemctl start docker
```

### Port Conflicts

```bash
sudo lsof -i -P -n | grep LISTEN
```

### Rebuilding Containers

```bash
docker-compose build --no-cache
docker-compose up --build
```

By following these detailed setup instructions, you can successfully run ProxyAuthRequired.com locally, enabling you to develop, test, and deploy the application effectively.
