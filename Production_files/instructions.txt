# Instructions for SSL/HTTPS Setup and production (For Future Me)

## Before CERT

-Remove -X from file names

-replace old files with prouciton files in ProxyAuthrequired root directory

### Step 1: Prepare the Certbot Directories
1. Make sure the directories `certbot/conf` and `certbot/www` exist in the root of the project.
2. If they don't exist, create them manually:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p certbot/conf certbot/www
   ```

### Step 2: Ensure Docker is Running
- Start Docker if it's not already running:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl start docker
  ```

### Step 3: Launch Docker Containers (First Time Setup)
- Bring up the containers to ensure everything runs as expected:
  ```bash
  docker-compose up --build -d
  ```

### Step 4: Obtain the SSL Certificate (One-Time Setup)
- **Make sure the domain ProxyAuthRequired.com is live and DNS is configured.**
- Run Certbot manually to issue the SSL certificate:
  ```bash
  docker-compose run certbot certonly --webroot --webroot-path=/var/www/certbot -d ProxyAuthRequired.com -d www.ProxyAuthRequired.com
  ```

### Step 5: Verify SSL Certificate
- Check the certificate files generated in `certbot/conf/live/ProxyAuthRequired.com/`:
  - `fullchain.pem` (Public Certificate)
  - `privkey.pem` (Private Key)

### Step 6: Reload Nginx with SSL Config
- Reload Nginx to apply SSL:
  ```bash
  docker-compose restart nginx
  ```

### Step 7: Test the Website
- Visit the website in a browser:
  - **https://ProxyAuthRequired.com**
  - Ensure the lock icon appears, meaning SSL works.

### Step 8: Automate SSL Renewal
- Certbot should be auto-renewing every 12 hours as defined in `docker-compose.yml`.
- To test renewal manually, run:
  ```bash
  docker-compose run certbot renew --dry-run
  ```

### Troubleshooting Notes
- If SSL certificates aren't issued, check:
  - **DNS Records:** Ensure the domain is pointing to the correct server.
  - **Nginx Logs:** Look at `/var/log/nginx/error.log` for possible issues.
  - **Certbot Logs:** Look at logs in `certbot/conf/`.
